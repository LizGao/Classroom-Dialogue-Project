## Introduction:

* **Background:**
  
  This project is the design product of Qingyi's PhD research project on classroom dialogue and science subjects in secondary education. Her research uses design-based research (DBR) method. She expects the product will undergo two to three iterations according to her collaboration with first-line school teachers. The product aims to facilitate student-student and student-teacher **classroom dialogue**, as well as students' **intrinsic motivation** to engage with the learning materials. Her research aims focus on (i) finding supports and challenges taht science teachers in China face when trying to conduct high-quality classroom dialogue; (ii) investigating the design components in which secondary school students find intrinsically motivating for them to engage further in learning and classroom dialogues. She may also look at (iii) whether neurodiverse students benefit more from the design product.

* **Classroom Dialoge:**


* **Intrinsic Motivation in Learning:**


## Scale:
   Product User: students & their teachers, high school Freshman/ Sophomore, taking at least 1 science class (physics/ chemistry/ biology/ psychology)
	
   Product Type: software application, available on phones and computers
	
   Product Development Timeline: 09/2024 ~ 09/2025, design app based on user interview and research purposes; provide 2 update versions after 09/2025 based on feedback.
	
   Product Scenario: 
	
      Before Class: teachers prepare for in-class discussions/ students preview lecture materials. 
		
      In Class: teachers present or control in-class discussions/students complete tasks
		
      After Class: teachers reflect on class discussions & student comments/ students complete take-home tasks. 
		
   Product Goal: promote classroom dialogues, and improve students' intrinsic motivation in learning



## Design:

* **Introduction**

  Our serious game product will have two modes, including (1) **solving** fantasised teaching content-related **problems** by role-playing in a group setting and (2) **previewing** and **reviewing** the teaching contents by having dialogues with the characters through *independent* choice making and feedback receiving. We decided to use these two modes because we wanted to provide a platform which invites students, especially those who are quiet, into classroom dialogues, so that (a) they learn implicitly, through simulation, how to use dialogues to communicate science knowledge; (b) they can be intrinsically motivated to learn more sciences; (c) their multimodal interaction with other students, teachers and teaching materials may be observed effectively; (d) their cognitive processes may be visualised automatically to their teachers to guide lesson preparation. The teaching content-related aims are **to be determined** with first-line secondary school teachers.
